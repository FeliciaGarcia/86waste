This app is called 86 waste. I wanted to make a platform for people with zero waste lifestyles to connect and share ideas and resources.

Users are able to log in, create a post, edit their posts, delete a post, and see the posts of the other users. 

The tools that I used include devise for authentication, AngularJS on Rails for my front end and back end frameworks, and omni-auth for what will eventually be a second form of authentication for users.

Challenges that I faced building this app was mainly integrating angular to rails. Although these two frameworks add great user experience, they are not the most compatible with one another. When deploying to heroku, you do have to install a buildback for ruby and for angular so that heroku can pick up on the languages that we're using. 

In the future, I want to add business models that users can create to keep track of bulk stores in their area and organize them by city. I also want to have business accounts that can post information about the products that they have available for their consumers.
